      <Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="18" >MusicPlayer Help</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>MusicPlayer can play any sound file (=track) Windows supports. Tracks can be combined into
        Playlists. Their content can be played in sequence or randomly.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>To use MusicPlayer, follow these steps:</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource Header}">1) Setup directory for storing MusicPlayer data</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>When MusicPlayer starts for the first time, it asks the user where it can store its data. The
      user can also enter a directory for backup, if this is required.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Setup menu allows changing these values also later on.</Paragraph>
      
      <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource Header}">2) Import tracks</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>With the Import menu, the user can tell which tracks should get added to the MusicPlayer. 
        When adding a track, the MusicPlayer simply stores the location of that file in its data store plus 
        some track properties like title, artist, genre, etc. These properties can be entered with the Windows 
        Explorer, which is a bit cumbersome, or by rightclicking on a track and executing "Rename". Renaming 
        will not change the file name, but the properties like title.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>It is often convenient to create immediately a new playlist of these tracks or to add them to an
      existing playlist. This is done by entering a name into the playlist field.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource Header}">3) Play tracks</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The Tracks window shows all tracks the MusicPlayer know. The user can sort them by clicking 
        on a column header or filter them by entering a search string in the filter field or selecting a value 
        in the artist, genre, etc. dropdown boxes.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Double clicking on a track starts playing this track. At the bottom of the window are some 
        buttons for pausing, positioning the track, skipping to the next track or changing the volume. If the
        user selected several tracks, the MusicPlayer will keep playing only these tracks. If only 1 track is
        selected, the MusicPlayer will play all tracks in the window.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource Header}">4) Create Playlists</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The user can mark some tracks in the Import or Tracks Window and add them to a playlist, 
        which opens the Playlist Window. Here the user can rearrange the sequence of the tracks, remove tracks
        from the playlist or select some tracks to be added to an existing or new playlist.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource Header}">5) Managing Playlists</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The MainWindow of MusicPlayer shows all playlists. Double clicking on one opens a new Window for that 
        playlist.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>To play that playlist, click on it in the MainWindow and then click on the Play button at the bottom of the 
        Window. MusicPlayer will remember which tracks it has played already, even if it gets stopped and 
        restarted. Only once it has played all tracks, regardless whether shuffle mode is on (random play) or 
        off (sequential play), will it repeat playing a track. The right grid in the MainWindow shows the tracks 
        in the selected playlist which have not been played yet.
